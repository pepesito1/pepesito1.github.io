	<p>if you get to look at the list of every game ive ever played (99% accurate), youll notice theres like this huge ratio of nintendo to non nintendo games. this is because i, probably, grew up with those consoles and as such i acquired a taste for them. for games without handholdy dialogue, where youre guided with colors, noises, space and white space rather than with on-your-face dialogue and button prompts.</p>
	<p>and, i mean, my point with these ramblings, really, come from the fact ive realized i really am not part of the new generation anymore. stuff just isnt being made for ME anymore. and im turning cranky. and im constantly thinking of these arguments where i believe i am objectively correct about how videogames nowadays fucking suck ass even though someone may have said that about the games i grew up with</p>
	<p>and my ramblings, of a kid turned teen turned young man, are about how i believe elitism is not wrong, and gatekeeping is correct.</p>
	<p>i mean, i could make an enormous rant about this. but suffice to say i believe going for mass appeal by following corporate trends kills franchises emotionally for me, ruins any fun or lasting cultural impact they could have. just going for the widest possible amount of people inherently implies dumbing down things as much as possible, making them as same-y as everything else as possible.</p>
	<p>and, i think, thats where gatekeeping stuff from people comes in. thats why monster hunter wilds has absolutely horrendous performance even though 10 year old games look as good as if not better than it and why everything is a paid cosmetic now and why the game released half finished. its just what sells, what corporate pennypinchers thought was right to do. and in a sense it was right to do. it broke records. broke sales. fastest selling playstation 5 game at its time. all that. and heres where i also think the game industry being smaller than, say, the movie industry, also created better games</p>
	<p>consoles are absurdly strong nowadays. innecessarily strong nowadays. and i do believe limitation breeds innovation. its why metal gear solid 1, super metroid, a link to the past, etc. were so absurdly good. why breath of the wild running on what was really xbox 360 and ps3 hardware made it so mind numbingly good. why the wii being even weaker than a playstation 2 when the playstation 3 was already out had such amazing creative games. because stuff is tailor made for it. insane optimization is made because of mere necessity. and it breeds creativity. and i think</p>
	<p>i just think the industry is way too big nowadays</p>
	<p>and its why you have so many mainstream sports games and shooters that are really just clones of each other. because the industry being as absurdly huge as it is today means that as bad as something will be, someone will be there to buy it. and it creates disposable games. stuff with 0 lasting cultural impact.</p>
	<p>see, expedition 33 won game of the year yesterday, in 2025. and if you take the time to play it, i mean, its a good game. its a good jrpg. just made by white people so you can take that j safely out of jrpg. and its a pretty nice (j)rpg, its just one whose target audience is the overwhelming majority of players that care mostly about the nicest graphics and whatever is trendy at the moment. and it got awarded indie of the year. and you know indies werent always like this. its a nice rpg whose biggest selling points are its graphics. indies used to be like cave story and undertale. not... a triple A game. it just doesnt make sense.</p>
	<p>and thats the thing. game libraries used to be smaller. you still had slop. movie tie in games. but you knew that whatever was a first party game was going to be good, because it was made to innovate and compete againts others who where innovating and competing. whereas nowadays games reached a point where theyre just that. disposable. just as generic summer blockbusters with tom cruise. it doesnt make sense. there is no need to innovate and compete anymore in terms of graphics because we reached a plateau with the 2013 consoles.</p>
	<p>and this is where my cranky ramblings come in. stuff just wasnt like this when i was younger. im 22 now. i think we still had slop back then, but the selection of games was smaller. you could just simply ignore the slop. because the overwhelming majority wasnt buying that slop. literally no magazine ever thought to nominate the captain america 2011 movie tie in videogame as one of the best ever. but you have people trying to call the guardians of the galaxy game (that is very evidently riding off the popularity of the movies with the same name which are also engineered to appeal to as wide an audience as possible) one of the best ever. which doesnt make sense. how is elden ring one of the best games ever? had you never played a game without dialogue before? how is expedition 33 one of the best games ever? had you never played a jrpg before?. its not even about being a blind fan either. its just that back then you knew that if something was announced you knew it was most likely going to be good, and clever, and human made. nowadays you cant really know that. you cant know that the newest playstation 5 exclusives are going to be good, because theyre not innovating anymore. they hit their stride and they know what sells. i dont think they really knew that before. i think there was a point sport games and shooters didnt dominate the market the way they do nowadays. and a lot of those get cranked out, because its just what sells. and as succesful as zelda was i dont think you had the whole industry creating twilight princess clones. and as good as half life and metroid prime were i dont think you had the whole industry creating clones of games with silent tutorials.</p>
	<p>what do i know. maybe generic hero shooter #57129 announced yesterday at the game awards will really be someones favorite game, the way breath of the wild is one of my favorite games. maybe expedition 33 is someones favorite game because they just werent used to playing jrpgs, the way i loved bowsers inside story because it was one of my first jrpgs ever. maybe i really am just cranky. maybe i just hate anything obsessed with photorealism, live service, first person shooting action and microtransactions. maybe im just too fucking cranky. maybe someone my age in 2017 hated breath of the wild because they hated anything survival related with crafting elements in an open world, which was a fad at the time, the same way live service shooters are now. and maybe games really WERE better when i was younger, when not everyone could just crank out slop and publish it themselves. everything went through quality assurance. i could download the best 10 playstation 2 games right now and probably enjoy them. but there is no such thing as the 10 best series s/x games. it just doesnt make sense. theres far too many games now. far too many genres, far too many games inspired by OTHER games, far too many indies, far too many companies dedicated to making disposable games. and i dont like disposable art. i hate the jurassic world movies. i hate dc movies. i have stranger things to the point it makes me mad if i start rambling about it (im stupid like that). i legitimately fucking hate disposable media that appeals to the widest market possible. and i think the majority of games now are like that instead of being the minority. the games industry is nearly as big as the movie industry and i grew up in the era leading up TO that, not IN that</p>
	<p>the videogame industry has stagnated since 2013-2015 and i am very glad to have been a part of the era where huge technological leaps were constantly being made and games were made to be ran on 8 megabytes of ram, not 8012 megabytes. i always thought i was born a little bit too late. im glad i didnt grow up with an xbox one or ps4. really. im glad i did not grow up with disposable media.</p>
