	<p>i just</p>
	<p>come from fixing a massive fuckup i had accidentally done somehow</p>
	<p>somehow i had like, copied half the table. SOMEHOW. and then i somehow pasted it randomly like halfway into the document which just made everything get messed up and duplicated. i spent so long fixing it. also for whatever reason an extension i usually turn off for my webpage (darkreader) started injecting a bunch of css into the html file because it didnt get turned off properly because of some quirk and that copy i usually to upload to github. i had to fix that. i ended up simply going back to a 2 months old version of this list and then simply readded everything i had added since. it was just easier that way rather than trying to erase the custom css in the document which was a huge mess and trying to un-duplicate everything.
	</p><p>my point is</p>
	<p>this page has about a 95% accuracy for every game i have ever played. at most im missing random pc shovelware and random meaningless xbox gamepass games. every other game i have ever played is in here. for sure every game i really care about like ace attorney and outer wilds are in here. and im constantly making sure im not missing anything but after having played so many games for so many years of my life. perhaps im missing a couple. i pray i dont because i want this to be as accurate as possible. for instance i just thought about how the last story was not in this webpage and i added it as such. when i randomly think of some game i always come in here to see if it actually is in here and is not missing. and i weep for every game that is not here that i cannot think of or somehow missed.</p>
	<p>this webpage is kind of a logistical nightmare. could be worse but the way i coded everything is messy.</p>
	<p>i constantly add games as i play them. i should NOT be missing anything.</p>
	<p>EDIT 1: this edit was added on 05/11/2025. today (2:35 am as of writing this) nintendo released a new app. which lets you see fucking playtime data all the way back to the wii u. me, being obessed with dates and storing everything about my life the way i do, saw this as an opportunity to add a bunch of new data to this webpage. did you know i have 834 hours on call of duty: ghosts and opened it 966 times on the account i played it in? i did not! i thought monster hunter 4 ultimate was the most played game of my childhood! i also opened miiverse 2187 times on my main account and have 222 hours on it! i added a lot of new notes as such. i do not have however all the data of my original 3ds account (i had 2, one i lost which is an absolutely tragic story that tears me up, i lost so many friends and streetpass data).</p>
	<p>seeing the ratio of times i opened a game/total hour playtime since i was a kid in 2013 with this new wii u info surprises me a lot because apparently i also could only bear to play a game at pretty much 1 solid hour (give or take) at a time. like. SINCE I WAS A KID. and im still like that. my body is very good and telling when ive spent an hour playing something. anyways. i most likely first opened it on the 3/27/2013 with lego city undercover and the following day with new super mario bros u.</p>
	<p>edit 2: this edit was added on 17/11/2025. retrieving my wii u data motivated me enough to FULLY extract all my wii data, both with physical games and homebrewed games. there are a bunch of surprising things such as me getting my wii surprisingly late on its lifetime (my first play on it was on 25/06/2010 at 05:33:12, clock most likely slightly wrong anyways) and me only having 6 hours on the chick chick boom demo (most demos arent listed in here. bit trip demo and cave story are 2 other demos i very fondly remember) even though i remember it so well. also i have a total of 2427 sessions (dunno if it means amount of apps opened or boot cycles) all on my wii.</p>
	<p>i also have a bunch of stuff i care about, like a bunch of my monster hunter save files backed up so i might share those at some point too</p>
	<p>here's a link to explore a couple of my wii logs: <a href="/renewal/playlog.txt">playlog.txt</a>. i did notice a few oddities. there is no wii sports data which im sure i also have dozens of hours on. id need to plug in my wii to see if the data is there or if its just a quirk of the program. also no twilight princess or skyward sword data whatsoever. maybe i really did play them in my wii u. i just dont remember and my vwii data got wiped cuz i had to basically factory reset it at some point. sorry.</p>
	<p>ANYWAYS</p>
	<p>enjoy</p>
	<p>(i also opened the internet browser a collective amount of 2976+1138=4114 times and have a collective amount of 2614+1082=3696 hours between 2013 and 2016 on my 2 accounts in my wii u. do not judge me.)</p>
